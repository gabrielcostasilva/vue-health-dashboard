# Vuetify Health Dashboard
This project is based on an ["AAE IdeaPro" Vuetify tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAo_kUyhQzw).

## Project Overview

This is a health dashboard that shows off several Vuetify components. However, this is a design exercise only. It means that there is no behaviour in this app. In addition, all code is in one single page - no components. Checkout other branchs to see the evolution of this project.

### Main Screen

The main page consists of three parts: a side bar, the main dashboard, and the user dashboard.

## Branch Features

This branch breaks down the original structure into individual components. In addition, we created routes for sidebar options. Checkout commits to see the changes.
